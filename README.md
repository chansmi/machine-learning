Various ML coding projects

### HW - 1
Creating cooreelated data and running various algorithms to understand their success in various situations.
### HW - 2
The purpose of this assignment is to conduct exploratory data analysis on a merged dataset. EDA should allow us to uncover information about the data such as trends, relationships, and patterns. It also can be used to identify parts of data that needs to be cleaned. By the end, we gain the necessary experience to handle, analyze, and visualize real world 'style' data which can be messy.
